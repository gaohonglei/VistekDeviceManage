Hierarchic visualization control for wxPython 

Hierarchic data visualization control intended for use with 
structures where "parents" hold collections of weighted children.

Can be used for viewing sizes of directories on file-systems,
running-time of functions in profiling, or time spent on tasks 
in a time-tracking application.
